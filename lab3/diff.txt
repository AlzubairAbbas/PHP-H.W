Difference Between MySQL and MariaDB
The difference between MySQL and MariaDB is considered a very important topic in the field of databases, especially due to the close relationship between them.
MariaDB was originally created as a fork of MySQL by the original creator of MySQL, Michael “Monty” Widenius, after concerns arose regarding Oracle’s acquisition and control of the MySQL project.

Below are the most important fundamental differences between the two systems:

1. Licensing and Development Model
MariaDB
MariaDB is fully committed to the open-source philosophy and is released under the GPL license.
All of its features are freely available, ensuring transparency and continuous community-driven development.

MySQL
MySQL follows a dual-licensing model and is owned by Oracle Corporation.
While a free Community Edition exists, many advanced features and tools are only available in the Enterprise (paid) editions, which include proprietary components.

2. Performance and Speed
MariaDB
MariaDB often demonstrates better performance, especially in complex queries and high-concurrency environments.
It benefits from advanced storage engines such as Aria and ColumnStore, and generally handles a large number of simultaneous connections more efficiently.

MySQL
MySQL prioritizes stability and reliability, particularly in enterprise environments.
However, in some scenarios, especially with complex queries, it may perform slightly slower compared to MariaDB unless enterprise-level optimizations are used.

3. Storage Engines and Technical Features
MariaDB
MariaDB provides more storage engines by default and supports advanced features such as:

Dynamic Columns

Multi-source replication

These features give developers more flexibility and control.

MySQL
Recent versions of MySQL introduced strong features such as:

Advanced JSON support

Common Table Expressions (CTE)

Although these features now exist in both systems, their implementation details differ slightly.

4. Compatibility
MariaDB
MariaDB is designed as a drop-in replacement for MySQL.
This means MySQL-based applications can usually switch to MariaDB without changing PHP code, as they use the same ports (default 3306) and APIs.

MySQL
Starting from newer versions such as MySQL 8.0, MySQL has begun to diverge slightly from MariaDB, which may require additional care when migrating from MySQL to MariaDB.

Quick Comparison Table
Feature	MySQL	MariaDB
Main Developer	Oracle Corporation	MariaDB Foundation (Community-driven)
Primary Focus	Stability and enterprise integration	Performance, innovation, openness
JSON Support	Very advanced and well-structured	Very good
Data Encryption	Mostly available in paid editions	Available in the free version

Which One Should You Choose?
Choose MariaDB if you are looking for:

High performance

Fully open-source software

Advanced features without additional cost

Choose MySQL if you:

Work in an environment heavily integrated with Oracle products

Prefer using the most widely adopted industry standard with strong corporate backing
